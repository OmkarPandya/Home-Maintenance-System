If your heater is electric, shut the power off from the circuit breaker box. The correct fuse should be labeled as belonging to the water heater. 

If it’s a gas-powered water heater, shut off the gas by turning the valve on the gas supply line that runs to the tank.

The water in your water heater is extremely hot.
