Cleaning a ceiling fan should be done at least once a year. You however need to reach it first by standing on a stool or something elevating. Start by cleaning the blades with a brush and then use a damp cloth that has been dipped in soapy water to remove the remaining sticky stains. Leave the fan to dry on its own before using it again. You can easily find a fan brush from any home equipment store near your house. Also, you can vacuum out the motor as dust can accumulate on it and cause a fan to run slow.

Use your vacuum. It may sound strange to use your vacuum cleaner to dust your ceiling fan, but the vacuum is actually an easy way to rid your fan of dust.Attach your vacuum’s brush, and hoover the top and bottom of each blade.

For a quick clean, use a feather duster.

If the dust is especially thick, use a damp cloth and gently wipe the top and bottom of each blade after hoovering. Just remember: never use harsh cleaners that could warp the blades or damage the finish.
Use a can of compressed air to blow any dust out of the motor housing

Ceiling fans are made of different parts that are put together using screws. While the fan is running, it generates small vibrations that loosen some of those screws. You can detect loose screws through a noisy or shaky fan. Simply use a screw driver to tighten back those screws with special focus on the fan, ceiling plate and the light fixture – if available.

It is important to check your ceiling fan for movements or wobbles. The center of the fan should not make any side movement while the fan is in operation. If it does, the fan needs to be balanced. You can use a fan balance kit to do this. Also, it is important to note that a faulty blade may cause a fan to wobble. Check to see if there are parts missing on blades. Lastly, it is important to check if there is any bent or warped blade. You can do this by removing all blades and place each on top of another. The blades should fit perfectly on top of another
