Cleaning with distilled white vinegar is a great way to ensure your shower is left mold free. Using a rag, just wipe down the shower glass, door, and hardware with undiluted white vinegar to eradicate mold and mildew.

Use baking soda with a little tap water to make a "runny paste" and apply it on a cleaning cloth or sponge. Use this concoction along with some elbow grease to remove tough hard water stains and other grime including mildew buildups on faucets and on tile.
