If you wish to maintain the quality pictures that your LED TV produces for years, then be sure to alter its brightness settings. 

The simplest thing you can do to make sure that your LED TV will last long is to turn it off. 

Where you place your LED TV is an important factor that adds or subtracts years from its lifespan. DON’T set it up near a window, the sun will damage the components.

Use a voltage regulator with a battery back up in case of power dips or surges. This prevents the power caps from going BAM! when other electronics switch on and draw electricity.
