Buy an additional pre-filter on your next RO maintenance visit and replace the filter yourself after 3 months. All you need is a special spanner for opening the external body of the filter. 

Do not ever ignore any drips and leakages from the main body of your purifier system. It could mean booster trouble and that will ruin your machine.
