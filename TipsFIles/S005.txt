Always use detergent made for high-efficiency (HE) machines, and use the minimum amount (more is not necessarily better). 

Remove finished loads immediately. Do not let damp clothes sit in the machine . Care should be taken to ensure pets or children don't climb in.

When not in use, leave the door of the washer ajar, to improve air circulation inside the machine and to prevent the buildup of mold and mildew.

Clean out the washer door's rubber seal thoroughly with a half-half solution of water and vinegar regularly
