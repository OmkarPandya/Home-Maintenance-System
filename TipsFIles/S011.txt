Wipe your stovetop after each use.

Wait until the burners and surrounding areas have completely cooled before cleaning them.

Take the burners apart to soak and then clean them thoroughly in warm, soapy water.

Soak and then scrub the grates in warm, soapy water. For stubborn spills and stains you can use grate cleaner.

Stubborn cooked-on spills can be cleaned with a mild abrasive paste made from baking soda and water.

Rinse all parts in clean water.

Dry all parts thoroughly before replacing them - placing them in a warm (but not hot!) oven for around 15 minutes is a good trick.

Dislodge any cooked food caked under or on burners and on the surface of the cooktop.

Clean clogged burner holes with stiff wire, pipe cleaner or a pin.

Replace the burners correctly. There is a small hole in each of the burner base pieces where the flame shoots out and connects with the burner - if the hole isn’t matched with the corresponding opening in the burner the flame won’t ignite.
