Households tap need to be serviced at least once every two years, though this depends on local water pressure and day to day use – sometimes annual basis maintenance might be in order

Switch off water supply and detach the tap from the wall water outlets do this carefully as there will be leftover water in the plumbing though there should be no water pressure

Disassemble the tap and remember the order in which parts are to be reassembled – missing a single washer will be a problem

Clean all elements of the tap and remove any residue, mould, built up etc. – this is best done using hard bristle brush, perhaps a small amount of degreaser too

Replace all existing O rings with new ones – sometimes rings might appear sound, when in fact they are hardened and rotting thus the cause of your leaky tap

In all cases, you must lubricate the tap spindle, do this using a quality lubricant that has high water resistance as you don’t want the grease to be washed away too soon

Check if the tap fits properly in its seat, if you see gaps around the seat try and reseat the tap, the better you do this the less chance of leak later on

If performing maintenance on shower taps, seal the shower spindles with a small amount of silicone before reassembly
