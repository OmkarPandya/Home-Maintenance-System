Clean refrigerator about twice a year, using a toothbrush and a solution of baking soda and water. 
 
Keep the fridge between 37 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit and the freezer at 0 degrees.

Cool foods and drinks help absorb warm air that streams in when you open the door. 

If you are the eat-out type or your fridge is too big for your needs, store a few jugs of water in there.
